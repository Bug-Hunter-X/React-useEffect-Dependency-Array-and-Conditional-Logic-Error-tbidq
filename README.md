# React useEffect Bug: Incorrect Conditional Logic within useEffect

This repository demonstrates a common error in React's `useEffect` hook involving incorrect conditional logic within the effect function and its dependency array.

## Bug Description
The `MyComponent` uses `useEffect` to log a message when the `count` state variable is greater than 0.  However, the conditional statement `if (count)` is incorrect because it evaluates to true even when `count` is 0 (a falsy value).  This leads to unexpected behavior and potentially unnecessary logging.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Observe the console logs and the component's behavior.

## Solution
The correct conditional statement should be `if (count > 0)`.  This ensures the message is only logged when the `count` is strictly greater than 0.

## Learning Points
- Always carefully consider the conditions within your `useEffect` functions to avoid unexpected behavior.
- Ensure your dependency array includes all the values used within the effect function.  Missing or incorrect dependencies can lead to unexpected re-renders and unexpected behaviors.
- Pay close attention to falsy and truthy values in JavaScript when dealing with conditional statements.
